# Welcome to my personal [website](https://saurish.com)

I'm Saurish Srivastava, a sophomore at [Evergreen Valley High School](https://evhs.schoolloop.com/ "Evergreen Valley High School") in San Jose, California. This website contains a little bit of information on me and was a project I picked up during quarantine.

This wesbite is created with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). The amazing terminal design is from [@crearo](https://github.com/crearo).

To be honest, I haven't a clue for what else I should be writing here, albeit, feel free to contact me if you have any questions @ [me@saurish.com](mailto:me@saurish.com)!
