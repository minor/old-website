Hey, there! Recently, I hopped on the hype and started learning Next.js. I really wanted to make a minimalistic website that still allows me to **learn** Next.js, and broadly: the React framework.

Originally, I was dazzled by how *quick* Next.js is. It's lightning fast and with websites like [Vercel](https://vercel.com) and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) offering deployment for **free**, it seemed like a no-brainer to me. My original website design (big shout out to [@crearo](https://github.com/crearo) for allowing me to use their template) and sort of my inspiration for this version is available on [Heroku](https://saurish.herokuapp.com/) and the source code is available [here](https://github.com/minor/flaskwebsite).

It has a blog and also comes with a functional dark mode with no annoying screen flashes :)

I'm glad I made the change from HTML/CSS -> Flask -> React Framework with Next.js - it's really allowed me to understand web design a bit better.

Here's a live link to the website: [https://old-website-ten.vercel.app/](https://old-website-ten.vercel.app/)

### Built With

* [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)
