          Hello there! Iâ€™m <span className="font-bold">Saurish</span>, a sophomore at <a href="https://evhs.schoolloop.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Evergreen Valley High School</a>.
          I love coding and enjoy messing around in different areas of computer science! I'm currently exploring <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/TensorFlow" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TensorFlow</a> 
          {' '}and <a href="https://nextjs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Next.js</a> (this website is built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS)!
          <br />
          <br />
          But, my true passion is: biology. I'm fascinated by fields such as oncology and neurology. I also really like taking <Emoji symbol="ðŸ“¸" label="Hello" /> (model and nature), which you can find on my <a href="https://unsplash.com/@saurishs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unsplash page</a>.
          <br />
          <br />
          Iâ€™m the president and executive director at <a href="https://envisionnew.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Project enVision U.S.</a>, a non-profit organization dedicated to the <span className="font-bold">community</span>.
          Our mission is to create a connected community where education is free and accessible. With COVID-19 removing most in-person contact, we've been committed to helping students from different communities through <span className="font-bold">online services</span>.
          I'm in charge of leading all active projects, managing the team, and teaching!
          <br />
          <br />
          I'm also an avid debater! I participate in Lincoln Douglas on the National Circuit. As of December, I have allocated 1 bid to the Tournament of Champions and have reached 2 bid rounds,
